This guide walks users through the necessary steps to construct, network, and deploy the Phyto-Arm system. Users are encouraged to innovate and build on our system to make Phyto-Arm work for their specific applications. Basic understanding of system networking and programming is assumed throughout the guide. We have tried to make this guide as user friendly as possible, and we appreciate your feedback. Please reach out to Michael Staiger ([michael.staiger\@whoi.edu](mailto:michael.staiger@whoi.edu)) with any questions or suggestions.
