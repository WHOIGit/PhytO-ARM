# Phyto-Arm Winch Building Guide

This guide walks through the necessary components for winch assembly on a PhytO-ARM system, along with instructions for setup and maintenance. In most cases, the necessary hardware can be determined by referring to the user manuals for individual components or referencing the drawings for any fabricated parts. A complete list of necesarry parts can be found on the Parts List page. This is a description of our system, every user may have different individual needs and should adjust and innovate to fit your specific application. You may choose to alter the order of steps, but this is the sequence we have found to be the easiest.
