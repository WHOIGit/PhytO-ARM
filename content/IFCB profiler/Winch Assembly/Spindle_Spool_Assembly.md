Next, fit the spindle over the output shaft on the gearbox. The spindle shaft is a shaft size step up moving the Conedrive output shaft from 5/8" to 1" and is provided with Waterman Direct Drive Deep Water Reels. Remove the setscrew in the spindle shaft and set aside. Coat the input off the spindle with Blue Grease HT or Molykote to prevent grinding and galling and apply some to the gearbox output shaft as well.

Align 3/16" X 1 1/4" machine key in grove of output shaft and slide spindle over locking in place. Apply some blue Loctite to the setscrew before tightening it in place. If the spindle isn't properly fitted or is loose, there will be increased wear on the key from moving the winch up and down.

Slide inner drag plate onto spindle shaft and screw into place, positioning so beveled holes are facing up and screws insert flush. Next slide one teal drag washer onto the spindle shaft. Then the spool, followed by another drag washer and then the outer drag plate. (Note: if your spool is already loaded with line make sure that it is in the correct orientation so the line will be playing out in the correct direction) The outer drag plate should have a protruding tab, align this tab with the slot in the spindle shaft. Slide the flat key through the slot at the end of the spindle. Run a small bolt through the key and tab, and tighten with a lock nut or regular nut using blue locktite. This nut does not need to be tightened down completely, but enough to keep the key from slipping, washers can be used to reduce wiggle space. Replace the drag knob on the end of the spindle shaft and screw to tighten down. The knob presses into the key, securing the spool on the shaft. The tighter the knob the stronger the drag. If the knob is not tight, the spool may slip on the shaft.

Note: Apply non-slip decking tape to the inside of the spool to increase the grip the line will have. If played out too far without enough friction on the spool, the line may simply rotate around the spool as it turns. Secure your line on the spool by running the line through a loop at the end around the center of the spool. We have used _____ style of line to support our IFCB installations. This line is rated for ____ lbs and has proven rugged enough for extended deployments.
