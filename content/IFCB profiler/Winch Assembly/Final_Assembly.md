Secure the top plate and boom mount to the top of the gearbox. Coat the bolts in Aquashield to prevent corrosion before tightening in place.

Once the boom mount is on, position the boom slats. Each slat should have a hole near the end, if using more than one, line them up and secure with the eye bolt and lock nut. Loosen the bolts holding the plates on top of the gearbox together, but note that you will need to use longer bolts than the standard ones Hiliner provides if you use more than two slats. Tighten the bolts down bit by bit in an X pattern, so the boom is under more or less even pressure on all sides while you adjust it. When properly aligned, the end of the boom should be in line with the center of the spool. Feed the line through the pulley secured on the end of the boom.

Tune the winch before deploying. Check the alignment on the boom by placing a weight at the end of the line and raising and lowering it several times. The line should feed cleanly through the pulley and wrap across the spool evenly. If the boom (and therefore the line) is properly centered, the line will wrap to one side of the spool and then back across to the other.

Some users may prefer to connect the two power cables and Ethernet cable to the MAC400 motor at this stage, others find it easier to make these connections earlier or once the winch is fully installed. Fit the cable glands over the connectors and tighten using the sleeve on the end of the cable. Wrap the connections in electrical tape for extra security, making sure to stretch the electrical tape slightly to ensure good contact.
