Drawings of stand and mounting parts can be found on the [Parts List](https://hablab.whoi.edu/phyto-arm/overview/parts_list/). Secure the lower section of the winch stand to the mounting block or deck with lag screws or use bolts with lock nuts if the underside of the decking is easily accessible. Since the load will be centered past the front of the stand, be sure the back leg is secure and will not tip.

Once the stand is installed, attach the stand insert to the base of the gearbox using the threaded bores. Fit the bolts with lock washers and coat the threads in Aquashield to prevent corrosion.

Seat the ConeDrive gearbox and post in the stand base, and adjust the height as needed. To secure the stand at the appropriate height, run a bolt or pin through the paired holes in the stand base and post. Tighten with a lock nut.

When motor, gear box, stand, and boom mount are all assembled they should be oriented as pictured below. With the leading edge facing the direction of the water or where the winch is to be deployed.
