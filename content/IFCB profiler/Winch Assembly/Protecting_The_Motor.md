### Current System

The MAC400 motor is rated [IP66](https://rainfordsolutions.com/products/ingress-protection-ip-rated-enclosures/ip-enclosure-ratings-standards-explained/#:~:text=The%20IP%20rating%20or%20IP,voltage%20not%20exceeding%2072.5%20kV.&text=This%20standard%20defines%20levels%20of,tools%2C%20dirt%20and%20liquid%20water.) and could theoretically withstand splashing and spraying in the marine environment. We chose to give it some added protection due to its relative investment cost. After some trial and error we chose to go with [hook and loop sealed anti corrosion bags](https://www.mcmaster.com/anti-corrosion-bag/). This cheap and easily installed solution worked well for us, but other options or no protection may be needed depending on your situation and deployment parameters.

To use this solution simply slide the bag over the MAC400 on the final assembled Phyto-Arm system and close the hook and loops where possible. Hit the bag with a heat gun to shrink the bag and reduce size of openings for environmental damage.

### Previously used system:

We have previously used a fabricated metal box with one opening to protect the motor. While this system gave the motor more protection from the elements, it also made the motor much more difficult to access. We decided that between this difficulty and the price difference to go with the off the shelf anti corrosion bags. However, some users may find the extra protection of the box to be desirable.

To use this system you will need to fit the Motor into protective Case. First, Set #10 bolts in the bottom and top holes on the motor face, four in all, with washers between the bolt head and the motor casing.

This next step is easiest done with the case placed upside down with the opening facing up. With the bolts in place on the motor, carefully tip the motor forward and guide the motor shaft at an angle through the face of the case. Press the back of the motor down until it is in place at the bottom of the case. This may take some force, but it will slide into place. Adjust so the motor face is seated in the opening in the case. Tip forward so the bolts slide through the bores in the case. Insert a hex key through the slots on either side of the case and find the bolt head. Holding the bolt in place from the inside, finger-tighten a lock nut on the end of each bolt. This will ensure that as the motor is moved around, the bolts don't slip out fall into the case. When docking motor to conedrive gearbox simply remove these lock nuts.
