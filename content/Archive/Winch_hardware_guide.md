title: "Winch Assembly & Installation"
---

*Alma* can accommodate up to three winches that can hold CTDs, IFCBs, ESPs, or chains of instruments. As of 2020 there are mounting blocks for two winches (South and West), a third (East) can easily be added.

This guide walks through the necessary components for winch assembly, along with instructions for setup and maintenance. In most cases, the necessary hardware can be determined by referring to the user manuals for individual components or referencing the drawings for any fabricated parts. You may choose to alter the order of steps, but this is the easiest way for most users.

#### Installing the Winches

To begin, secure the lower section of the winch stand to the mounting block or deck with lag screws or use bolts with lock nuts if the underside of the decking is easily accessible. Since the load will be centered over the front of the stand, be sure the back leg is secure and will not tip.

Once the stand is installed, attach the stand insert to the base of the gearbox using the threaded bores with 3/4" long 5/16" bolts. Fit the bolts with washers and coat the threads in Aquashield to prevent corrosion.

Seat the gearbox and post in the stand base, and adjust the height as needed. To secure the stand at the appropriate height, run a bolt or pin through the paired holes in the stand base and post. Tighten with a lock nut.

Next, fit the motor in the aluminum case. 
Set two #10 bolts in the bottom two holes on the motor face with washers between the bolt head and the motor casing.

With these in place, carefully tip the motor forward and guide the motor shaft at an angle through the face of the case. Press the back of the motor down until it is in place at the bottom of the case, and adjust so the motor face is seated in the opening in the case. Tip forward so the bolts slide through the bores in the case. Line up the thin aluminum plate with the motor face, this plate will be held in place with the same bolts keeping the motor seated in the case.

Insert a hex key through the slots on either side of the case and find the bolt head. Holding the bolt in place from the inside, use a small wrench to secure a lock nut on the end of each bolt. Set the remaining two bolts into the bores on the top side of the motor and secure to the plate in the same way.

This is a good time to connect all the cables to the motor, though you can also do this after the motor is mounted. Fit the cable glands over the connectors and tighten using the sleeve on the end of the cable. Wrap the connections in electrical tape for extra security.

The coupler for the motor shaft and gearbox input shaft is made up of 3 separate pieces and a keyed shaft to fit in the gearbox input.

Secure the motor shaft coupler with the two set screws. Coat the set screws in Loctite, and tighten down with one set screw resting the in keyway on the motor shaft. Repeat for the keyed shaft, adjusting as needed so the coupler pieces fit together snugly.

To mount the motor to the gearbox, the bores on the plastic spacer and gearbox input shaft need to aligned. Apply a small amount of Molykote to the gearbox input shaft with a cotton swab (be careful, it is very messy if it gets on clothing or skin). Filp the case so the open end is facing down. Coat the 3" long 3/8" bolts in Aquashield and run through the outer bores on the metal plate. Slide the spacer over the bolts and make sure the shaft coupler components are tight.  

Line up the bolts and keyed shaft. You may need to turn the input shaft or adjust the coupler to align the shafts. Slip the bolts through the gearbox flange, and while supporting the motor and case, fit the bolts with washers and lock nuts. This is easiest with two people, or with the hardware in your pocket bracing the case with your knee to keep it from slipping backwards. Be careful to not jostle the case too much as you secure it, this can cause the shaft coupler to come out of alignment.

Use a wrench to hold the bolt heads in place while you tighten down the nuts. Fully assembled, the motor case and spacer should fit snugly against the gearbox flange. If any bolts are loose, the load can sag, putting strain on the coupler or causing misalignment between the shafts.

**If the motor is properly fitted to the gearbox, there should be no noise when the motor runs. If you hear whining, grinding, or mechanical clicking, the coupler is not properly aligned. New users may need to refit the motor several times to achieve a good fit. **

Cover the slots on either side of the case with electrical tape to prevent water from leaking in. The motor and control module are both highly resistant to spraying or splashing water, but we want to keep it to a minimum.

Remove the knob from the end of the output shaft and mount the spool. Be sure the spool has a teal nonslip pad on either side as you mount it.

Fit the metal ring with the tab over the end of the output shaft, and slide the flat key through the slot. Run a small bolt through the key and tab, and tighten with a lock nut. This nut does not need to be tightened down completely, but to keep the key from slipping. Replace the knob on the end and tighten down. The knob presses into the key, securing the spool on the shaft. If the knob is not tight, the spool may slip on the shaft.

If the boom is not already fitted onto the gearbox, do so now. Each slat should have a hole near the end, if using more than one, line them up and secure with the eye bolt and lock nut. Loosen the bolts holding the plates on top of the gearbox together, but note that you will need to use longer bolts than the standard ones Hiliner provides if you use more than two slats. Tighten the bolts down bit by bit in an X pattern, so the boom is under more or less even pressure on all sides while you adjust it. When properly aligned, the end of the boom should be in line with the center of the spool. Feed the line through the chock secured on the end of the boom.

Tune the winch before deploying. Check the alignment on the boom by placing a weight at the end of the line and raising and lowering it several times. The line should feed cleanly through the chock and wrap across the spool evenly. If the boom (and therefore the line) is properly centered, the line will wrap to one side of the spool and then back across to the other. 

#### Deployment & Maintenance
When deploying, remove anything that could be damaged or shaken loose during transit. During breaks and once you arrive at the site, check all bolts and tighten as needed, they will slowly become loose while trailering.

At the site, check all cable connections and ensure you can control the motor. If you haven't already, secure the cables to the stand with zipties. The motor should run smoothly, and there should be little to no noise coming from the gearbox. If there is squeaking or other noise, remove the bolts, spacer, and case, and realign the coupler before putting it back together. The coupler will move and slip a little over time, so check for excessive noise whenever site visits are required.

Make sure the boom is properly aligned. When doing longer casts, the line may wrap differently than over short distances. Make sure the line feeds evenly from one side back to the other and does not favor one side. If this happens, the line will pile up against the side of the spool and slip, resulting in loops of line getting stuck underneath the line being fed onto the spool. This will result in the line jumping suddenly during a downcast, jerking the logger and preventing smooth, steady data collection.

When adjusting or replacing the coupler, check for any signs of galling or grinding along the input shaft. If there appears to be galling or you're not sure, apply some additional Molykote to the shaft in the coupler, key, and input shaft. Use a swab to get the Molykote all the way to the back of the input shaft. Bolts should also be examined for signs of corrosion; apply more Aquashield to the bolt threads if needed.

- Box wrench set & socket set
