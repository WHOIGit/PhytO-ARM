This section of the PhytO-Arm guide is currently in development. The opperation and control of the winches through the PhytO-Arm software has changed from year to year. The most upto date information can always be found on our [github repo](https://github.com/WHOIGit/PhytO-ARM/tree/main). As we work to finalize the integration of this system new features will become availible and will be documented on this page. 

We currently operate our system using a series of ROS bags contained in [Foxglove studio](https://foxglove.dev/). Lots of information on this system can be found on our [github repo](https://github.com/WHOIGit/PhytO-ARM/tree/main). The following pages provide a guide on deployment and opperations of this system. This system utilizes the internal computer of the IFCB as the "brains" of the system. Once the PhytO-Arm software is installed onto your IFCB a series of easy commands allows you to control a variety of sensors and winch positioning.
